## Status
- Work in progress
### To-do's
- Host website on netlify instead of Github Pages - Github Pages has some weird interactions with Redirects.
- Rewrite frontend with MUI instead of Bootstrap
- Allow the Portfolio to track ALL ERC20's.
- Use a subgraph to grab historic data instead of centralized Coin Gecko API

## Approach
Useable for every network
A portfolio app which allows the user to EITHER log in via Unstoppable DOMAIN or via metamask.
Fetches all ERC20's instantely and visualizes their Historic data.
